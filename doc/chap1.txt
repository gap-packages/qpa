  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YGeneral aims[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  overall  aim of [5XQPA[105X is to provide computational tools in basic research
  in  mathematics  (algebra). It seeks to furnish users within and outside the
  area  of  representation  theory  of  finite  dimensional  algebras  with  a
  computational  software  package  that  will help in exploring a problem and
  testing  conjectures.  As  with  all  software  development,  new  ideas and
  question  will arise. The ability to study and compute examples will help in
  proving  or  disproving well-established questions/conjectures. Furthermore,
  it will enable us to consider new examples which were not accessible by hand
  or  other  means  before.  In  this  way,  we  hope that [5XQPA[105X will aid in the
  development,  not  only  of  the  area  of  representation  theory of finite
  dimensional  algebras,  but  also  of  a  broad  variety  of  other areas of
  mathematics,  where such structures occur. In addition we aspire to create a
  research   environment   for   international  cooperation  on  computational
  representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.[133X

  [33X[0;0YSince  the release of GAP version 4.7.8, the package [5XQPA[105X is distributed with
  GAP,  so  if  you  download  this  version  or any later version of GAP, the
  package  [5XQPA[105X  will be installed at the same time as GAP is installed. Follow
  the     instructions    for    installing    GAP    on    the    web    page
